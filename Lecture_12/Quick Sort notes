Quick Sort notes:
bigO: O(n(logn))
	This is the most popular general sorting method.
	**If original data is inversely sorted then O(n^2), very bad.**
	Because of this, we usually try to test if data is inversely sorted first.
	If it is, then don't use this to begin with, instead use something else.
	
	Does not require extra space**
	
Uses Partitioning to sort, this value is known as our *Pivot Value*

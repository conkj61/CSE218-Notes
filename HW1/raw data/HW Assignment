CSE218 HW1 Classes, Objects and Bags

Build a program with the following three modules and for each method you write, please
specify its big O complexity level.

1. (Name Warehouse) Download the three text files attached in this assignment. They
	contain 600 girl’s names, 600 boy’s names and an unknown number of last names,
	respectively. You will build a name warehouse that will import these names into one
	single array containing 1200 name objects. Each name object will contain first name,
	last name (randomly picked from the last name text file), and gender. If you find
	yourself doing a lot of manual work while importing these names, you are doing it
	wrong. Write a Demo program to test the module.

2. (Name Factory) Use the name warehouse built from the last step to create a name
	factory. The name factory will allow the user to enter a letter and a gender, it will
	display all the name objects whose first name starts with that letter for that gender. The
	output has to be sorted alphabetically and displayed in a text area on the screen AND
	a new text file stored in the project folder. The text file name has to be different each
	time so older files will not be overwritten. Write a Demo program to test the module.

3. (Student Factory) Use the name factory to construct a student factory. The student
	factory will return one student object each time when a gender is provided to it. The
	student class will contain the following fields: first name, last name, gender, a unique
	id, and a random GPA between 0.0 and 4.0, inclusive. Write a Demo program to test
	the module.

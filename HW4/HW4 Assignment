CSE218 Homework Problem Set 4

1.  Write a generic binary-search method.

2.  Implement a generic bag class that works with Comparable objects only. The bag
	should have the following methods: add, display, findMax, findMin, deleteMax,
	DeleteMin, and insertionSort. You need to implement JavaFX GUI, so the user can
	choose which type of objects (choose from Integer, Double, and String) to be used in
	the bag. You should then allow the user to enter some values. You must then
	implement a series of buttons, each invoking one aforementioned method and
	displaying the corresponding result when clicked.

3.  Implement a game board with 10 X 10 cells and a “Undo” button below it. Each cell of
	the game board is made of a JavaFX button. When the user starts the game, a ladybug
	image will be placed on a random button on the board. As the user clicks on any one
	of the cells, the bug will jump to that cell. The bug will travel as such as long as the
	user continues clicking on cells. When the user clicks the UNDO button each time,
	however, the bug will back-track one step. The bug could travel back to its original
	starting position if the user wishes to do so.

4.  The same problem as described before. But this time, the bug is only allowed to jump
	to an adjacent cell, not remote ones. Clicking on a remote cell will simply produce an
	error message alert. The “Undo button” will still allow the bug to back-track a step
	each time it is clicked.

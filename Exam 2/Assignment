Write a functions interface called Chargeable that has a method called charge(). Develop a java program
that allows you to charge the following chargeables in the following ways:
	1. Car (Id'ed by license number, charge $7.00 each)
	2. Truck (Id'ed by license number, charge $10 each)
	3. Pedestrian (Id'ed by social security number, charge $3 each)
	4. Bike (Id'ed by vin number, charge $4 each)
	
The program will be used at a ticket booth at Port Jeff Ferry so it can take up to 70 cars,
30 trucks, 200 pedestrians and 100 bikes. These chargeables must be stored in a data structure.
The program, with GUI or without GUI, must calculate and generate an invoice for each chargeable item
the moment the chargeable shows up at the ticket booth as fast as possible. It will also calculate the
total charged amount collected for the entire data structure upon request.
